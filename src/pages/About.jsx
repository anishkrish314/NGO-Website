          <p>
            Helping Hands was founded in 2020 with the goal of bringing compassion and resources to those most in need. Since then, we have organized community drives, provided educational materials to schools, and run health camps in rural regions.
          </p>
          <p>
            Our dedicated team of volunteers and supporters are the backbone of our operations. We collaborate with local leaders, educators, and healthcare providers to create long-lasting impacts.
          </p>
          <p>
            We invite individuals from all walks of life to participate and contribute to our mission. Together, we can make a meaningful difference.
